# experiments
 a repository for experimenting

## This is a place to play and (potentially) break stuff without worrying about if it works or not
- be brave
- take chances
- build MORE

### Ideas:
- make Amazon mock site more functional
- build test for React Sample and JS Sample pages and change names on portfolio to "... Samples with Tests"
- update portfolio site with author page
